1. __call__ method
-> Allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. 
-> When you define __call__ inside a class, you can use objects of that class like regular functions.

2.__new__ method
-> responsible for creating instance.
-> this method will be called before __init__
-> used in scenarios like singleton patter(class which will have one instance only)
